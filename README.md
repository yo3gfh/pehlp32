I've organized bits and pieces from the original PEDump code in this DLL as part
of a university lab project (a task manager). Thanks to Matt for all of his work in
bringing the MS Windows guts to more light. Please note that this is cca. 20 years
old code. I digged it from the bowels of my drive and spiff it a little bit to 
compile with Pelles's C compiler and to generate a 64 bit version as well. It was
good fun, make what you want of it. I've included the archive with the PEDump code
as well.

It's taylored to my own needs, modify it to suit your own. I'm not a professional programmer,
so this isn't the best code you'll find on the web, you have been warned :-))

All the bugs are guaranteed to be genuine, and are exclusively mine =)
